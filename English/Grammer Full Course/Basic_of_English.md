<h2 style='color:green; font-size: 30px;' id='basics'>Basics</h2>

English language have `26` letters. Letters are also called sound. These are the essentially sounds and the purpose of creating alphabets was to create sound and create a representation for that sound.

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>What is Word?</strong><br>
A word is a collection of letters which has a meaning. If there is a group of words which has no meaning that not will be the `word`.<br>
<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Vowels</strong><br>
`A, E, I , O , U`
These above 5 words are vowal words. When ever we have to pronouns these words we can pronouns these without use of lips and toungue.<br>
Other words are called `Consonant`.<br>
<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>What is Sentence?</strong><br>
Sentence is a `collection of words which have some sense`. When we combine some words so in the result we create a sentence.<br>
<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>What is English?</strong><br>
When we start grouping sentences we create english. This is the whole concept and I have to learn english.

<h2 style='color:green; font-size: 30px;' id='sentences'>Sentences & Its Types</h2>
There are several types of sentences in English. Some are as follows:
<br><br>
<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Assertive Sentences(declarative):</strong><br>

The sentences in which we dicuss `General idea`, `thought`, `fact` or `habits`. There are some more types of Assertive sentences. Either it can be `Possitive(Affirmative)` or `Negative` sentences. There are almost `70%` real time sentences belong to this type.

- <div style='color: aquamarine'>Affirmative Sentences:</div>

    Affirmative sentences are the sentences in which we talk in `yes(han)` manners.
- <div style='color: aquamarine'>Negative Sentences:</div>

    are the sentences which includes `not(nahi)` or give `not` type word like `no`.

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Interrogative Sentences:</strong><br>
The sentences in which `question involves`. For instance we `ask a question` or `someone ask question`. These sentences must have `?` mark at the end of sentence.

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Imperative  Sentences:</strong><br>
The sentences in which an `advice`, `command`, `order` or `request` involves that sentences are called imperative sentences. Fundamentally a `Instruction` will me given in these sentences.

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Exclamatory Sentences:</strong><br>
The sentences in which `surprised(harani)` element involves are called exclamatory sentences.`!` mark is his recognization and exclamatry mark come at end of the sentence.<br>
For Instance:

1. What a shot!
2. oh no!
3. Yeah! I got this. 

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Optative Sentences:</strong><br>
The sentences in which `prayer(dua)` element involves are called optative sentences.<br>
For Instance:

1. May you live long
2. May god bless you
3. Wish you all the best

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>How a sentence made?</strong><br>
We have `3` ingredients for making a sentence. which are:
```
Subject + Verb + Object.
```

<h2 style='color:green; font-size: 30px;' id='subject'>Subject, Verb & Object : Predicate</h2>

In this lecture I will learn all about `Subject`,`Verb` and `Object`. So let's start:

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Subject:</strong><br>

Subject is a part of Sentence and in sentence `which perform an action` is called Subject.<br>
For Instance, highlighted text is subject:

1. `I` am watching TV.
2. `The people` are fighting for their rights.
3. `Saad` is using his phone.

> Now we will dicuss the types of subject there are `three` types of subject.

<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Simple Subject:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Simple Subject is the normal subject which we discuss in the subject topic.</p>

<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Complete Subject:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>We have mith the subject is only one word. But, Subject can be a whole sentence and which come under the complete subject defination. In complete subject <i style='color:yellow'>a modifier is used to demonstrate</i> that subject. the modifier inhance or it will be more detail about that subject.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>A beautiful cat which I bought from shop was run.</li>
<li>The book which Rohan give me was very greate book./li>
<li>The Iphone which You bought from Lahore was not so good.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> As we can see there are few inhancers are in the above sentences these inhancers `modifiers` are also part of the subject
<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Compound Subject:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Some times there will not be only one subject. There can be <i style='color:yellow'>2 or more subject</i>.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>Amir and me was gone Dinga today.</li>
<li>Dear Sir and me are both good teachers.</li>
<li>The University and Collage plan for a sports gala.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> As we can see that there are more than 1 subject can be in an sentence

<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Object:</strong><br>

Object is a part of sentence `which recieve the action` is called Object.<br>
For instance, hightlighted text will be Object:

1. I am watching `TV`.
2. The people are fighting for their `rights`.
3. Saad is using his `phone`.

> Now, there are also two types of object which is discussed bellow.
<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px;'>Direct Object:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Direct objects are the normal object which receive action.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>I eat pizza</li>
<li>Roshan met me</li>
<li>Ali is going to die.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Indirect Object:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Direct objects are the objects which receive direct object. We incounter some sentences which have two objects one will be direct object and second will be indirect object.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>He gifted me a book.</li>
<li>My friend send me a message.</li>
<li>She give me her vehicle.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> In the all above sentences there are two objects and in the all above senteces `book`, `message` and `vehicle` are the direct object and `me` receive all the direct objects is called indirect object.


<strong style='color:brown; font-size: 20px;'>Pradicate:</strong><br>
Pradicate is the `action` which is performed in sentence. We can also call it `Verb`. There are also three types of pradicates.

<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Simple Pradicate:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Simple Pradicate is the <i style='color:yellow'>action</i> which is happening<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>He gifted me a book.</li>
<li>My friend send me a message.</li>
<li>She give me her vehicle.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> In the all above sentences `gifted`, `send` and `give` are the examples of `Simple Pradicate`
<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Complete Pradicate:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Complete Pradicate is the complete part of the sentence which is not the subject. It means other things in sentence which are not subject come under the Complete Pradicate.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>He gifted me a book.</li>
<li>My friend send me a message.</li>
<li>She give me her vehicle.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> In the all above sentences `gifted me a book`, `send me a message` and `give me her vehicle` are the complete pradicates
<div style='color: aquamarine; margin-left:20px'>Compound Pradicate:</div>
<p style='margin-left:30px'>Same as name. Means The Sentences which have <i style='color:yellow'>more then one action</i> come under the compound Pradicates example.<br>
For instance:
<ol>
<li>You have to work hard and show consistancy.</li>
<li>We have to leave this city and never return.</li>
<li>In previous match your performns was good and very responsive.</li>
</ol>
</p>

> In the all above sentences `work hard` and `show consitancy` are the two actions in the same sentence is an example of compound predicate

<!-- End of Subject , Object and predicates topic -->

<h2 style='color:green; font-size: 30px;' id='translation'>Translation in English</h2>

Structure of sentence
```
Subject + Verb + Object.
```
As we know these three things need for a sentence. <br>

> A Subject or Object must be `Noun` or `Pronoun`. And also we now that the pronouns are used most as compare to noun.

> As we know that when a `Pronoun` used as `Subject` so we use `Nomination case` and when used as `Object` we use `Objective case` and When pronoun used as `Verb` we use `Possesive case` in sentence.

Some common Pronouns list: 

| Nomination case | Possesive case | Objective case |
| -- | -- | -- |
| I | my,mine | me |
| We | our,ours | us |
| You | your,yours | you |
| They | their,theirs | them |
| He | his | him |
| She | her,hers | her |
| It | its | it |
