<h2>Setting up the App.jsx</h2>

in `app.jsx` teacher make a speacial hirarchy and classes and call elements accordinly so please visit for more clear view.

<h2>Creating NavBar.jsx</h2>

Then from there we move to `Navbar.jsx` and we make some imports and then teacher add some tailwind classes. I simply copy every thing and move forward. My primary goal is to compelete the project successfully.<br>
**Key Point**: in the Navbar teacher add a letter which was his logo for the website and also teacher how to create self logo by just going on [logo.com](https://logo.com/) website.
