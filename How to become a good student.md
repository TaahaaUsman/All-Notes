**This is a story:**
<p style='margin: 0 10px;'>I am a system and when I trying to prepare something. I put a lot of input into the system. and when I did not find the desired output. So, then I frustrated.

Mostly when we try to learn something we make progress at the start but after a few times we think we are stuck in one place and our progress slows down. Then we have to do a self-analysis. Take time and give feedback to yourself and find the loopholes, change your strategies according to lackness of work. Start preparing again and when feel the same situation, Do the same.</p>
