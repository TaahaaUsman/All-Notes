There are three types of exercises, which i should do for life time.

1. Physical exercise 
2. Facial exercise
3. Mental exercise 

so, my next step will be:

1. As I daily exercise body at gym, make time of these other two types of exercise.
2. Plan and make workout routines for the other exercises type.
If go to gym, then do, these as well.
