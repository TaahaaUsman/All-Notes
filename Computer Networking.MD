is an electronic device that recieve the signals and retransmite it. Repeater is used to extend transmite the signals so it can cover longer distance.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Rack:</h2>

Rack is like table or networking device holder. it arrange all networking devices in a manner.

<h1 align='center' style='color: red; font-weight:800;'>Topology</h1>

Topology is an arrangement of networking devices in a network.

**Types:**

1. `Physical topology` : arrangement of networking devices 
2. `Logical topology`  : transmission of data between devices

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Bus Topology:</h2>

In bus topology every device is connected through a main back bone cable called bus.And number of devices connected with the main cable.

**Advantages:**

1.  Easy installation, because a single wired connection needed to back bone.
2. Less cables required than mesh and star topology

**Disadvantages:**

1. If a single connection or bus is fail, whole system will be break down.
2. Difficluty in fault detection.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Star Topology:</h2>

In star topology all devices are connected with a central hub or switch. If some device want to send data so, it have to send data to the hub or switch. And central device trasnmitte the data to destination.

**Advantages:**

1. Easy installation.
2. Less cable required because each device need only a I/O port and needs to be connected with one link.
3. Robust, if one links fails other links works just fine.
4. Easy fault detection.

**Disadvantages:**

1. If hub goes down, all network will break down.
2. Hub need aditional resources and regular maintenance. 

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Ring Topology:</h2>

In this topology two devices connected with either sides of node. It forms like a ring that's why we call it Ring topology. In this if a node want to sent data to the other node, Node have to send data to the next node in clock wise direction. And the reciveing node work as a repeater and it intend the sigals and forward the packet.

**Advantages:**

1. Easy Installation
2. Cost Effective
3. Managment is easier becasue if we want to add a device only two links are requid to bhi changed.

**Disadvantages:**

1. If a single device break down whole system will be break down.
2. Data Trafic issues. 

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Dual Ring Topology:</h2>

This is just like ring topology but the diffirence is only that in dual ring signal can be send as clock wise or anti clock wise.

**Disdvantages:**

1. Number of port and cable is required more.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Mesh Topolgy:</h2>

In Mesh topology, every single node is connected with a dedicated path to every other node in the network. We can say that the connection only carrier the data between two devices only.

**Advantages:**

1. No trafic issues
2. Easy to fault detection
3. secure, because every node is connected with point to point connection.

**Disadvantages:**

1. Huge about of cable is required.
2. Number of I/O port is huge.
3. Scalability issue because a device can'not connedted with large number of devices.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Tree Topology:</h2>
Tree topology is mixture of star and bus topology. In this topology multiple star topology are connected with main cable.

**Disadvantages:**

1. If problem occurs in main bus cable the whole system will break down. 

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Hybrid Topology:</h2>
Hybrid topology is a combination of two or more topologies with each others is called hybrid.

**Advantages:**

1. We can choose topology on the based on requirements for example scalability is concern so we use star topology.
2. We can further connect other computer networks. 

**Disadvantages:**

1. Difficult to install.
2. Difficult for fault finding.
3. Design is complex. 
4. Maintenance is high expensive.

<h1 align='center' style='color: red; font-weight:800;'>OSI MODEL</h1>

OSI stand for `Open system interconnection` which is used to know the flow to data from point a to b point. And OSI model created by ISO(International Organization of standardzition) in 1984. And now it is considered as an artitectural design for inter-computer communications.

**There are 7 layer of OSI MODEL:**

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Physical Layer</h2>

Maintain the physically connectivity between networking devices. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies used to represent binary signals etc.

The presentation layer is responsible for formatting tha information to the application layer for further processing or delay.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Application layer</h2>

is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by the hosts in a commuincation network.

Signals of physical layer protocols:
1. Analog
2. Digital signals

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>What is TCP/IP model?</h2>

There portocols describe the movement of data between source and and destination over the internet.<br>

There are four layer in TCP/IP protocol:

1. Application layer
2. Transport layer
3. Internet layer
4. Link layer


<h1 align='center' style='color: red; font-weight:800;'>Transmission mode and transmition media</h1>

Transmission is a process in which user can send data or information to the network using network devices is known as transmission.It is a process of sharing information between devices.

<h2 style='color: aqua; font-weight:600'>Types:</h2>

1. Simple transmission mode:

It is one way communication and in this devices only can send data.Keyborad, mouse

2. Duplex mode:
    - (Half-duplex mode(HDX):
    This is an one way commuincation at a time. In one time only one device can send data.
    -  Full Duplex mode (FDX)):
    In this transmission devices can send and recieve data simultaneously.
