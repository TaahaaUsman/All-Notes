                    IDENTIFYING & WORKING OF NETWORKING DEVIES

Hub:
    is an central device which is used to connect multiple devices as a central point and it also connect single network segment and distribute it on the multiple devices.
        Advantages:
    1- It connect multiple devices.
        Disadvantegs:
    1- Broadcast
    2- Trafic
    3- Data Loss
Switch:
    is na cental devies which is used to connect multiple devices of LAN as a central point and connect singal network and distribute it on the multiple devies.

    Comparission between HUB and Switch
    1- work on physical layer           work on data link layer
    2- Come with limited number         Ports numbers are incresed
        of ports 4,8,12                 4,8,24,48
    3-Non intelligent                   Intelligent device

    5- Broadcast                        unicast,multicast, and broadcast

    Feathers:
    1- CAM table, ARP protocol
    L2 & L3 switch
    L2:
        is unmangeable switch because it has no feathers of routing
    L3:
        is manageable swictch because it works on networking layer and it can also provide routing.

Switching:
    in this tecnology, we create a reliable path between source to destination.
    Circuit switching:
      method to end-to-end communication and establish a dedicated path.
    Packet Switching:
      Diagram switching:
        in this process node can send data to destination independently. There is no dedicated path.
      Virtual packet switching:
        Network admin can create a dedicated path before forwarding the packet.

Types of data transmission:
1- Unicast
2- Multicast
3- Broadcast

what is FCS?
    FCS stands for frame check sequence. In this process we learn frame checking process while transmiting the data.
What is CAM table:
    stand for content address memory. it is used to store ip and mac address of devieces which are connected in switching network.

Routing:
    Router is an L3 networking device it is used to route the packet over the network.
    There are mainly two types of routers.
    IT is used to mange the WAN and LAN also.
    Key feathers:
    1- Enable security
    2- Route the packet
    3- Bandwidth
    4- Broadcast
    5- Destination marking

CISCO Router:
Cisco Router ports:
    Ehernet port: which is used to connect host, router or switch.
    Fast Ethernet: used to connect host, router or swtich.
    Gigabit port: Used to connect host, router or swtich.
    Serial port: used to connect routers.
    Console port: used to access the router for configration.
    Aux port: used to connect modem.
Modem:
    Modem stand for 'Modulator, Demodulator'. This is an hardware device which is used to connect switch, router to the internet. It is also convert the digital signals of a computer into analog signals that can bhi send and travel over the internet cables.
Access point:
    Access point is an hardware device which is used to increase network segment length. It creates a WLAN, usually it is used to inhance the area of an network created by the routers or switch.
Firewall:
    is an security point which filter the incoming and outgoing packet in the connection and protect the infrasturcture of network.
    There are two main concepts in firewall inbound(No one can access that software) and outbound(That software can'not access any thing from network). 
    Types:
    Software firewalls: All os have their firewalls.
    Hardware firewalls: is more secure and reliable for network security.
        Features:
    1- User can monitor network devices and create security ports.
    2- it can configure and control the port and access permission over a network.
NIC:
    stand for network interface card it is used to connect internet to pc. This is the card where ip address is asigned and also it have mac address.
    MAC address:
        stand for 'Media access control address'.it contain 12 digits of hexadecimal numbers. and have the size 48 bits. First six digits refer to the manufacturing company. Second six digits refer the location of network using.
Server:
    Server is a highly configure computer network device which provides the services over LAN and WAN.
Laptop:
Desktop:
Printer:
    Types of printer:
    1- Basic printer 
    2- Network printer is shareable printer.
Bridge:
    is a networking device which create a single aggregate network from multiple communication networks.
Repeater:
    is an electronic device that recieve the signals and retransmite it. Repeater is used to extend transmite the signals so it can cover longer distance.
Rack:
    Rack is like table or networking device holder. it arrange all networking devices in a manner.

Topology:
    Topology is an arrangement of networking devices in a network.
    Types:
    1- Physical topology : arrangement of networking devices 
    2- Logical topology  : transmission of data between devices

Bus Topology:
    In bus topology every device is connected through a main back bone cable called bus.And number of devices connected with the main cable.
    Advantages:
        1-  Easy installation, because a single wired connection needed to back bone.
        2- Less cables required than mesh and star topology
    Disadvantages:
        1- If a single connection or bus is fail, whole system will be break down.
        2- Difficluty in fault detection.
Star Topology:
    In star topology all devices are connected with a central hub or switch. If some device want to send data so, it have to send data to the hub or switch. And central device trasnmitte the data to destination.
    Advantages:
        1- Easy installation.
        2- Less cable required because each device need only a I/O port and needs to be connected with one link.
        3- Robust, if one links fails other links works just fine.
        4- Easy fault detection.
    Disadvantages:
        1- If hub goes down, all network will break down.
        2- Hub need aditional resources and regular maintenance. 

Ring Topology:
    In this topology two devices connected with either sides of node. It forms like a ring that's why we call it Ring topology. In this if a node want to sent data to the other node, Node have to send data to the next node in clock wise direction. And the reciveing node work as a repeater and it intend the sigals and forward the packet.
    Advantages:
        1- Easy Installation
        2- Cost Effective
        3- Managment is easier becasue if we want to add a device only two links are requid to bhi changed.
    Disadvantages:
        1- If a single device break down whole system will be break down.
        2- Data Trafic issues. 

Dual Ring Topology:
    This is just like ring topology but the diffirence is only that in dual ring signal can be send as clock wise or anti clock wise.
    Advantages:
        1- 
    Disdvantes:
        1- Number of port and cable is required more.

Mesh Topolgy:
    In Mesh topology, every single node is connected with a dedicated path to every other node in the network. We can say that the connection only carrier the data between two devices only.
    Advantages:
        1- No trafic issues
        2- Easy to fault detection
        3- secure, because every node is connected with point to point connection.
    Disadvantages:
        1- Huge about of cable is required.
        2- Number of I/O port is huge.
        3- Scalability issue because a device can'not connedted with large number of devices.

Tree Topology:
    Tree topology is mixture of star and bus topology. In this topology multiple star topology are connected with main cable.
    Advantages:
    Disadvantages:
        1- If problem occurs in main bus cable the whole system will break down. 
Hybrid Topology:
    Hybrid topology is a combination of two or more topologies with each others is called hybrid.
    Advantages:
        1- We can choose topology on the based on requirements for example scalability is concern so we use star topology.
        2- We can further connect other computer networks. 
    Disadvantages:
        1- Difficult to install.
        2- Difficult for fault finding.
        3- Design is complex. 
        4- Maintenance is high expensive.

            OSI MODEL

OSI stand for Open system interconnection which is used to know the flow to data from point a to b point. And OSI model created by ISO(International Organization of standardzition) in 1984. And now it is considered as an artitectural design for inter-computer communications.

There are 7 layer of OSI MODEL:
1- Physical Layer:
    Maintain the physically connectivity between networking devices. This layer defines the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies used to represent binary signals etc.
2- Data Link layer:
    is responsible for MAC addressing and LLC control checking.Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware.  
3- Network Layer:
    Network layer manages options petaining to host and network addressing managing sub-networks, and internetworking.
4- Transport layer 
    Transport layer protocol is showing the transmition process and information. In transport layer the data travel in segments(Full data).
    There are two types of transport layer protocols for trasfering the data.
    TCP(Transmission control protocol) : Best for secure connection
    UDP(User Diagram protocol) : Best for high speed tranformation
5- Session layer
    Session layer is used to check connectivity or session between end user. In case of connection loss Session layer try to recover it.
    PING command
6- Presentation layer
    The presentation layer is responsible for formatting tha information to the application layer for further processing or delay.
7- Application layer
    is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communications protocols and interface methods used by the hosts in a commuincation network.
Signals of physical layer protocols:
1- Analog
2- Digital signals

What is TCP/IP model?

    There portocols describe the movement of data between source and and destination over the internet.
    There are four layer in TCP/IP protocol:
        1- Application layer
        2- Transport layer
        3- Internet layer
        4- Link layer

                Transmission mode and transmition media
Transmission is a process in which user can send data or information to the network using network devices is known as transmission.It is a process of sharing information between devices.
Types:
1- Simple transmission mode:
    It is one way communication and in this devices only can send data.Keyborad, mouse
2- Duplex mode:
 (Half-duplex mode(HDX):
    This is an one way commuincation at a time. In one time only one device can send data.
 Full Duplex mode (FDX)):
    In this transmission devices can send and recieve data simultaneously.

Types of transmissions:
1- wired media (Ways, electromagnetic signals):
    Shilded twisted pair cable:
        cable has a fine wire mesh surrounding the wired to protect the transmission.
    Unshilded twisted pair cable:
    Fiber optical cable:
    Coaxial cable:

2- Wireless media (Radio Frequency):
