Brain needs Omega 3 fatty acids. And I choose 3 seeds for getting these three fatty acids.

1. Chia Seeds(chia seeds)
2. Flax Seeds(السی کابیج)
3. Walnuts


<h3>Week:</h3>

- **Day 1, 4, 7 (Walnuts):**

    - **Amount:** 1 ounce (28g) or about 7 whole walnuts
    - **How to use:** Add to oatmeal, yogurt, or as a snack.

- **Day 2, 5 (Chia Seeds):**

    - **Amount:** 1 tablespoon (15g)
    - **How to use:** Mix into smoothies, sprinkle on salads, or stir into yogurt.

- **Day 3, 6 (Flax Seeds):**

    - **Amount:** 1 tablespoon (ground) (15g)
    - **How to use:** Add to cereal, smoothies, or baked goods (like muffins or bread).


<h2>Key Tips:</h2>

- **Hydration:** Chia seeds absorb water, so drink plenty of water on days when you have chia.
- **Ground Flax Seeds:** Always use ground flax seeds, as the body absorbs nutrients from them more effectively than whole flax seeds.
- **Snack/Meal Pairing:** You can add these to your daily meals or use them as snacks to balance with other nutrient-dense foods.
